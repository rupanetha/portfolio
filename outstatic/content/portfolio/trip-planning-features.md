## The Project

I was tasked with designing a hotel booking application for use by foreign travelers coming to Japan. The purpose of this exercise was not to design a fully-fledged travel app, instead it was to showcase my design thinking process and to take the solution as far as I could in the short timeline I was given.\

## Discover and understand users

This section is all about discovering and understanding the user's needs, goals, and pain points. I set myself a few research goals before getting started.

1. Learn as much as possible about my potential users
2. Understand current solutions and the competitive landscape
3. Determine if and how I can leverage new technology and innovation

## Survey and user characteristics

I sent out a user [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdkHNyLfJW9uoObD8dhxwHNhYX5NzJCYeOO8lfQbrcadotNUQ/viewform) using Google Forms and received 80 responses. Here is a summary of the average userâ€™s characteristics:

- Between the ages of 25 and 64
- Travels at least once per year either with family or with a partner or friend
- Lives in an English speaking countries (USA, Canada, UK, Europe)
- Does not speak Japanese

**Limitations and assumptions:** Survey respondents were not pre-screened. Only about 1/3 of users have travelled to Japan before. I made an assumption that people trying to book travel abroad would have similar pain points to those trying to book travel in Japan.

## Early sketches

I started by sketching some user flows and early wireframe ideas.

## Last words

While carrying out this exercise I had to make assumptions and trade-offs in order to make progress and stick to the timeline. Here are a few of the constraints and trade-offs that I considered:

- **Usability testing:** I did not have time to carry out user testing in this exercise. Ideally, I have liked to incorporate feedback from users on the designs through usability testing at various stages of the design process.
- The design is only meant to demonstrate an idea, to show how a trip planning app could be designed and integrated into a travel booking app
- The planning feature has not been designed in its entirety, therefore Daria can only carry out the first few steps of planning a trip: discovering an area and browsing accommodations
